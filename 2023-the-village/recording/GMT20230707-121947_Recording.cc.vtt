WEBVTT

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:06.000
So. For the context what we saw on the left it's a pigeon house and for now we are using and it's like a studio and it's like a studio and, a terraced for a pool.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
We will see that later. And we try to We planted a lot of, fruits, trees.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Like a, and, Kiwi, I'm not sure we said, in English maybe.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000
So yeah, in several years that view will be quite different.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
It's a

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Hey Jim.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Yeah, no, I just love it the way you said. Oh, it's a small terrace for the pool.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Yeah, right.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
He

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Hi. I don't want that tour to be like that because it's not something for riches.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Okay.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:10.000
As I said at the beginning, I wanted to know how to say that. Alone I won't be able I won't be able to afford for such a domain that yes if as it's now divided by 5 it's way cheaper.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Okay.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
So here we have a look at the pool from yesterday and on the right you can see a banana trees.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
So hopefully.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Oh free very be bananas but From what I heard, the river is not good enough.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
So it's just be it just will be stay like that. I like, exotic trees.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Let's see in the future if it changes. Of I will I would really like to have bananas of course Yes, we should.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Let me change. I might have one. Let's see. So yeah, it's it's for a small terrace for the pool sorry it's in it's a big pool at the end.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:13.000
So if you continue. To walk, just, Here we have, the pool behind us and this is the garden.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000
So. Thanks, Debank. So we have, it's the garden.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:41.000
So the picture is not quite relevant because. It should be way marking let's say let's particularly but yeah at least we have we have we have we have self-sufficient strawberries, raspberries and so on so that's really cool.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
It's just that, I wouldn't imagine.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.000
I work it, it requires because for it's so much time in it, in several people.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
So I'm not complaining. Just that I didn't, know that before that. But at the end we can eat.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Our own food so that's magical. And, in the background, we can see the, See what in detail in detail.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:32.000
So I present show you, who made mobile out and house. My, And so yeah, You know what it is.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000
They seems like,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
I think they are p even the number of eggs we have every day. It's like a 20 to 30 eggs every day.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:52.000
So we need to eat a lot of cakes and and eggs. It's, it's cooler.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And on the left there is a temporary, smaller cage and you will know. In a second while.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:20.000
It's because we had our first, chick. I finally And his name is Cute because my son thinks it's cute so his name his name is like Like he's like, so I show.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And Leslie, it was, this is our next last project. So.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Yeah, he was an in, yeah, for 4, So here is like, our last project.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:46.000
It was a tough one because, we did it, we dig it, we dig it manually, my brothers and myself.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000
It's like a 6 meters, large on a 4 and it's deep by a 1 one meter and 30 cm.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:07.000
It was a hell of a, of a job and we did it like in 2 to 4 days from the morning to the end of the day we were completely out.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:16.000
But, yeah. The result is, motivating. So. So yeah, and we like challenges.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:27.000
What was, even more changing and here is the stage 2 because it's like, I We think it's about 200 kilos.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And, we needed to to carry it from the meal to there like Let's say it's one.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Les than 100 meters better for it was a It was insane. We were completely broken at the end.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000
So I hope it will be, it should stay there and don't move at all for the next, 100 years.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:01.000
For the next one tree. Oh no no no I have 2 brothers and myself so we carry it with my father too so we were we were 4.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Yeah, because yeah, at 2 it's impossible. We tried it. It's not possible at all and at at free it wasn't possible never and at 4 it was a So we did it, but yes, it's quite an adventure just to to have a status in the mean there.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Is that you end up. But yeah, I really like the finance. So. We just, we put, co inside the water and hopefully the nature will, do the rest.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000
To be for, frogs and so on. So. Let's see in, 6 months, or one year.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I can share a picture if you want later.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Yeah, let's have a look. There won't be an, too much picture because it's already a lot of features.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:10.000
So I just want to show a few flowers and animals. Flowers are from the garden and the we, how far was if I may and animals, one from, a photograph.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:20.000
But 2 features are on the on the river that is around us so it's like I would do that but I don't have the material and the patience to do that.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000
And I'm sorry for the You just copy past it like that. It's horrible, but you have a look.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:45.000
I really like the one on the right, because, I like it. Yeah. Yeah, from where the pet colours in the whole green background so Yeah, No, I don't do everything of indeed.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
The flowers, it's mostly my motor. End of I'm not sure I ate maybe I at one time.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:13.000
So I can't, yeah, it's the whole family. For instance, I'm more like, Yeah, I'm doing the when we, we get the trees, Yeah, I like very busy.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:22.000
But yeah, flowers is for my mother and the one of my brothers and the gardening is mostly my, dad with, my mother and, my brothers.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I do it from time to time but I can't say but I'm a specialist I don't like it very much.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:44.000
But yes, everyone has a Preferred the task flowers if we say So yeah. And about the animals.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Yeah, we have a lot of, animals like everywhere. We have a lot of, grass next.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
They are gentle, so there is no issue with a little kid. But, yeah. I really like, so that's perfect.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
We have a lot of frogs. We have a lot of frogs, even if a pool.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
So So poor ones.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000
And, in the, in the, we have so many builds, and beautiful birds.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:36.000
For instance, the one on the bottom rights. I think he's a, It's, in French we call it, He's not easy and in English it's called a right Eurozone whooping so yeah it's a beautiful build and He comes from time to time, like

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
in, so that's insane. But, yeah, we have a lot of birds, a lot of insects and so on.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000
So yeah, when nature is present and we need to, we try to control it because it's green everywhere, even in the world.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
So he need to clean up.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Yeah, and the end, the whole thing was, if you want to buy a whole village.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:14.000
They are real village that are for sale as of now and The prices come from, 300, K to 23 million of euros.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:39.000
So yeah, it depends. When you are your wallet if I say. But yes in France and I saw even in the states in Spanish Portugal you have sometimes from time to time villages to buy so If you want, it may be a lot more work than just 5 h or

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:49.000
What you have next and the issue of questions. Don't hesitate. I hope. I hope it was a clear enough.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000
I can Same if you want.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
